      ripe tomatoes is a traditional condiment put on tables in <em>taquer&iacute;as</em>
      and <em>cafeter&iacute;as</em>, bus stations and homey dining rooms.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve
      never been keen on tomatoes that fall short of that, like the common, mealy
      store-bought ones. But when the red fruit is full of perfume, <em>salsa mexicana</em>
      comes across with the balanced strength of sweet tomato, hot green chiles, crunchy
      onion and aromatic fresh coriander&mdash;flavors at the heart of the Mexican
      kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>This definitive, relishy sauce is available in every region
      of Mexico, with a texture that ranges from a beautiful coarse puree to an unhappy
      collection of grape-size pieces. The Yucatecan name for the mixture is <em>xnipec</em>
      (which means, rather picturesquely, &ldquo;nose of the dog&rdquo;&mdash;see
      variation recipe); in the rest of Mexico, it can be <em>salsa cruda</em>, <em>salsa
      fresca</em>, <em>salsa</em>, <em>chile</em>, you name it; and in Texas, you
      get it when you ask for <em>pico de gallo</em> (literally &ldquo;rooster&rsquo;s
      beak&rdquo;), which would get you something entirely different in West Central
      Mexico.</p>", instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><em>Chopping the ingredients.</em>
      Core the tomato, then optionally seed it by cutting across the width and squeezing
      out the seeds and liquid. Chop it very finely (so that no pieces are larger
      than 1/16 inch) and scoop into a small bowl. If you want a milder sauce, seed
      the chiles, then chop very finely and add to the tomatoes. Finely chop the onion
      and garlic and add to the bowl along with the coriander.</li>\r\n<li><em>Seasoning
      the sauce.</em> Stir in the salt, vinegar (or lime juice) and 1 tablespoon water,
      then let the flavors mingle for &frac12; hour or so before serving.</li>\r\n</ol>",
