Lay several tortillas on the grill and turn every 20 seconds or so until nearly crisp - depending on the heat of your fire this should take a couple of minutes. Brush the top of each tortilla completely (and a little generously) with the lard or oil, then sprinkle each with a tablespoon of chorizo. When the tortillas are completely crisp (they'll be richly browned underneath) and the chorizo is hot, remove them to a serving platter. Drizzle with the avocado sauce and sprinkle with the cheese.

And they pair perfectly with apples. So when you&#8217;re at the fall farmer&#8217;s market, buy your favorite apples and a few habaneros (thankfully, both are in abundance at the same moment) for this special cocktail&#8212;special for anyone who loves spicy. For me, &#189; of an habanero is the right amount. I typically roast a whole habanero with the apples, then roughly chop it and add it to the pureed apples a little at a time, until the flavor and heat at perfect. I encourage you to do the same. Combining apple brandy and roasted apple puree gives this drink a rich, roasty oaky flavor with hints of oakiness. A resonant reposado tequila fits in beautifully, offering an age-induced smoothess while preserving the tequila&#8217;s agave flavor. To make Peppery Cinnamon Salt, mix 3 parts coarse (kosher) salt with 2 parts ground cinnamon (preferably fresh-ground Mexican canela) and 1 part fresh-ground black pepper. "

    "instructions": "<p>In an ungreased skillet set over medium heat, toast the chiles, stirring them around for a minute or so until they are very aromatic (some will have slightly darkened spots on them). Cover with hot tap water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes.</p><p>In the same skillet, roast the garlic, turning regularly, until soft and blotchy-dark in places, about 15 minutes. Cool and slip off the papery skin.</p><p>Roast the tomatillos on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until darkly roasted, even blackened in spots, about 5 minutes. Flip them over and roast the other side - 4 or 5 minutes more will give you splotchy-black and blistered tomatillos. Cool, then transfer the contents of the baking sheet (including any juices) to a blender or food processor.</p><p>Drain the chiles and add them to the tomatillos along with the garlic. Puree, then scrape into a serving dish. Stir in enough water to give the salsa a spoonable consistency, usually about 1/4 cup. Season with salt, usually a scant teaspoon, and the sugar. Refrigerated, the salsa keeps for several days.</p>",
