    "instructions": "<p><ol><li><strong>Prepare the cornhusks.</strong> Cover the husks with very hot water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable. For forming the tamales, separate out 28 of the largest and most pliable husks&#8212;ones that are at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. If you can&#8217;t find enough good ones, overlap some of the large ones to give wide, sturdy surfaces to spread the batter on. Pat the chosen husks dry with a towel.</li><li><strong>Prepare the batter.</strong> With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the lard or shortening with 2 teaspoons salt and the baking powder until light in texture, about 1 minute. Continue beating as you add the masa (fresh or reconstituted) in three additions. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add <em>1 cup</em> of the broth. Continue beating for another minute or so, until a 1/2 teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light). Beat in enough of the <em>remaining 1/2 cup</em> of broth to give the mixture the consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon. Taste the batter and season with additional salt if you think it needs some. For the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so, then rebeat, adding a little more broth or water to bring the mixture to the soft consistency it had before.</li><li><strong>Set up the steamer.</strong> Steaming 26 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. To steam them all at once, you need something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico or Asian stack steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard cups in a large kettle. It is best to line the rack or upper part of the steamer with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with the steam and to add more flavor. Make sure to leave tiny spaces between the husks so condensing steam can drain off.</li><li><strong>Form the tamales.</strong> Cut twenty-six 8- to 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. One at a time, form the tamales: Lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering end toward you. Spread about 1/4 cup of the batter into about a 4-inch square, leaving at least a 1 1/2-inch border on the side toward you and a 3/4-inch border along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling down the center of the batter. Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause the batter to surround the filling). If the uncovered borders of the two long sides you&#8217;re holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if wide, roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk is small, you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.) Finally, fold up the empty 1 1/2-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed &#8220;bottom&#8221; leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strings or strips of husk around the tamal. As they&#8217;re made, stand the tamales on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. Don&#8217;t tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. They need room to expand.</li><li><strong>Steam and serve the tamales.</strong> When all the tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover cornhusks; if your husk-wrapped tamales don&#8217;t take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from falling over). Set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for about 1 1/4 hours. Watch carefully that all the water doesn&#8217;t boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is necessary. Tamales are done when the husk peels away from the masa easily. Let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for a few minutes to firm up. For the best textured tamales, let them cool completely, then re-steam about 15 minutes to heat through.</li></ol></p>",

Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast, until soft and blackened in a few spots, about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop.<p>While the garlic is roasting, break off the stems of the chiles, open them up, remove the seeds, then tear them into flat pieces. Toast the chiles a few at a time on a medium-hot skillet or griddle. Lay them skin-side up, press flat with a metal spatula until they are aromatic and lightened in color underneath &#8211; about 10 seconds per side. (If you see more than a whiff of smoke, they are burning.) Transfer the toasted chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard.</p><p>Transfer the drained chiles into a food processor or blender along with the garlic, oregano, black pepper and cumin. Measure in 2/3 cup of the broth and process to a smooth puree, scraping down the sides as necessary. If you&#8217;re using a blender and the mixture won&#8217;t move through the blades, add more broth a little at a time until everything is moving. With a rubber spatula, work the puree through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard the skins and seeds that remain in the strainer.</p><p>Heat the oil in a medium-size (4-quart) dutch oven over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, add it all at once. Cook, stirring constantly, as the puree sears, reduces and darkens to an attractively earthy brick-red paste (usually about 7 minutes). You&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s cooked enough when it has lost that harsh raw-chile taste.</p><p>Stir in the remaining 3 cups of the broth, partially cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. If the sauce has thickened past the consistency of a light cream soup, add more broth. Taste and season with about 1 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar--salt to brighten and focus the flavors, sugar to smooth any rough or bitter chile edges. Cover and set aside.</p></li><li><strong>Make the mushroom and swiss chard stuffing. </strong> Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute. Add the chard and stir until wilted and dry about 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup guajillo sauce. Cool to room temperature.</li><li><strong>&#160;Roast the tenderloin. </strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butterfly the tenderloin. Sprinkle with salt. Spread the cooled mushroom mixture over the surface leaving about 1/2-inch border around all sides. Roll up, as tightly as possible, and using kitchen string, tie every 1 1/2-inches, then tie once lengthwise. Push any stuffing that has fallen out back in. Rub the entire surface with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place on a rack, set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 30 to 40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 125 degrees for medium-rare. Remove from the oven, loosely cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. While the meat is resting, warm the guajillo sauce.</li><li><strong>&#160;Serve.</strong> Remove the kitchen strings and cut into 1-inch slices.

    "instructions": "<p><ol><li><strong>Make black bean sauce. </strong>Place the beans in a medium-size (2- to 3-quart) saucepan, cover with 3 cups water, remove any beans that float and heat slowly to a simmer.<br/>If using avocado leaves, toast them for a few seconds per side (they&#8217;ll become aromatic and lightly brown) over a medium gas flame or heated griddle. Add the avocado leaves (or fennel), <em>1/4 cup </em>of the chorizo and <em>1/2 </em>of the onion to the beans, partially cover and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are fully tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If you see the beans peeking up through the liquid, add water to cover them by 1/2-inch.<br/>Coarsely puree the beans in batches in a food processor or <em>loosely</em> covered blender. Return to the pot and add enough water to thin to the consistency of a medium cream soup. Taste and season with salt.</li><li><strong>The tortillas and chorizo. </strong>Set up a steamer (a vegetable steamer in a large saucepan filled with 1/2 inch of water works well); heat to a boil. Wrap the tortillas in a heavy kitchen towel, lay in the steamer and cover with a tight lid. Boil 1 minute, turn off the heat and let stand without opening the steamer for 15 minutes.<br/>Meanwhile, in a small (7- to 8-inch) skillet, cook the remaining <em>1 cup </em>of chorizo over medium-low heat until done, about 10 minutes, breaking up any clumps as it cooks. Drain off the rendered fat, cover the skillet and keep warm over very low heat.</li><li><strong>Finish the enfrijoladas. </strong>Turn the oven on to the lowest setting and warm a serving platter in it. Pour out 1 1/2 cups of the warm bean sauce onto a deep plate. One by one, dip both sides of the warm tortillas into the sauce, fold into quarters and transfer to the warm serving platter, laying the tortillas in 2 rows, slightly overlapping. Keep warm in the oven.<br/>Scrape any bean sauce remaining on the plate back into the pot. (If the sauce has thickened, add a little water to get it back to the original consistency.) Quickly bring it to a simmer, spoon it over the folded tortillas (there should be a considerable amount of sauce), strew with the warm chorizo<em>,</em> splash with the optional salsa, then sprinkle on the crumbled cheese, chopped parsley and the remaining sliced onion. Serve your delicious <em>enfrijoladas</em> without hesitation--they don&#8217;t take well to delays.</li></ol><p><strong>Advance Preparation: </strong>The black beans can be prepared through Step 1 several days ahead; the chorizo can be cooked, too. Store separately in the refrigerator, covered. Reheat the sauce slowly in a covered pan, thinning if necessary. Warm the chorizo<em> </em>before heating the tortillas and finishing the dish.</p><p><strong>Shortcuts: </strong> Though the flavor and color won&#8217;t be as nice, the beans could be replaced with 2 drained 15-ounce cans of black beans.</p><p><strong>Variations and Improvisation:</strong> The avocado leaf (or fennel) could easily be omitted or replaced with 2 or 3 canned chipotles <em>en adobo</em> or toasted-and-soaked red-black chipotles or <em>chiles pasillas oaxaquenos </em>(in fact, with the chipotle or <em>pasilla oaxaqueno </em>you won&#8217;t really miss the chorizo--either in the beans or on the top)<em>. </em>Spooning soft goat cheese onto the tortillas before folding them makes the dish more substantial (you can omit the cheese garnish, if you wish). Bacon, ham or other sausage can replace chorizo; <em>enfrijoladas</em> are also delicious splashed with Roasted Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa. In short, with bean sauce and tortillas as a base, you can vary toppings (or fillings) as you like.</p><p><strong>Plantain <em>Enfrijoladas </em>with Sour Cream<em>:</em> </strong>Prepare the bean sauce, tortillas and chorizo as described in Steps 1 and 2. Fry 1 diced ripe plantain in a little vegetable oil over medium heat until browned. Dip the warmed tortillas in the warm sauce as described in Step 3, filling them with a mixture of the fresh cheese and chorizo<em> </em>as they are folded into quarters and layed in an ovenproof baking dish. Sauce them, then bake them covered in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes or so, until very hot, then drizzle with a little crema or sour cream thinned with a little milk. Garnish with the fried plantains, onion and parsley.</p>",

So enfrijoladas are a great candidate for everyday eating.Recipe from Season 4, Mexico&#8212;One Plate at a Time"
