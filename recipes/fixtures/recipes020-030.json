Arrange the oven racks to the lower 1/3 and upper middle.</p><p>Place the broth, brown sugar and adobo sauce in a small bowl and whisk together until the sugar has dissolved.</p><p>In a very large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Brown the chicken on all sides in batches, a total of about 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Remove the chicken to a rimmed plate.</p><p>Next, saute the white onion until richly browned, about 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the onion to a small bowl, leaving as much of the fat behind as possible. You're now ready to start assembling your packages.</p><p>Cut eight 17 x 18-inch pieces of aluminum foil. Set aside. Unfold the banana leaves, cut eight &endash; 17-inch pieces choosing sections of the largest relatively unbroken leaves. Trim off the thin hard strip of the side of all the pieces. To make the pieces pliable, either steam them for 20 minutes or pass each one briefly over an open flame until it turns from dull and stiff to soft and shiny. Assemble the chicken packages as follows. One piece of foil, one piece of banana leaf, 3 to 4 slices of sweet potatoes, 2 to 3 pieces plantain, one piece of chicken, followed by a portion of the onions, and 4 to 5 strips of chipotles. Gather up the foil to create a boat shape, then drizzle 1/4 cup of the chicken broth mixture over the top. Wrap the banana leaf to completely cover the chicken, then fold the two long ends of the foil together to seal the top. Finally, fold up each end to create a sealed package. Transfer the chicken packages to 2 rimmed baking sheets and place in the oven. One sheet on the top rack and one on the lower rack. After 20 minutes, switch the baking sheets. Bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</p><p>Carefully open the foil packages and using a metal spatula, transfer the banana leaf package to a warm plate. Open up the leaf and fold it down to reveal the chicken. Drizzle any of the flavorful broth that is left in the foil over the top.</p><p><strong>Jill's Wine Recommendation: </strong> I like to pair red chiles with red wine, so I think because of the sweeter flavors of the plantains, sweet potatoes, and brown sugar I would use a Zinfandel. The spicy, rich fruit of the 2008 Easton Zin from Amador County, CA will make a great match.</p>",

    "instructions": "<p><strong>1. Shred the beef jerky.</strong> Lay the jerky on a baking sheet and set under a heated broiler. In 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the thickness and dryness of the jerky, the fat will bubble on the top and the edges will be lightly browned and crispy. Cool the meat, then tear into thin shreds. Reduce the shreds of meat to fluffy, fine threads: Either pound them a little at a time in a mortar (it should look like a coarse, loose felt), or process them in 2 or 3 batches in the blender, pulsing the machine on and off quickly, until the meat looks like a fluffy heap of light-brown threads.</p><p><strong>2. Make the filling.</strong> Heat the lard or oil in a medium (10-inch) skillet over medium high. When the oil is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the threads of jerky, reduce the heat to medium and stir frequently until the mixture is well browned and the meat crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more. (If the meat absorbs oil immediately, add enough so the mixture fries and browns rather than toasts.) Add the poblano, tomato and garlic and cook several minutes until the mixture is homogenous. Taste and season with salt (jerky can vary widely in saltiness so salt carefully).</p><p><strong>3. Finish the burritos.</strong> Roll 1/4 cup filling in each warm flour tortilla and serve at once.</p>",

Juice the lemon and 1 blood orange. You need 1/4 cup of each juice.</p><p>Supreme the 2 blood oranges over a separate bowl by cutting off the white pith to expose the fruit, then, cut between the membranes to release the segments. Squeeze the juice from the membranes. Scatter the orange segments over the top of the lettuce taking care to leave the juice behind. Measure the juices and add them to the blood orange juice if you need them to make the 1/4 cup. Pour the blood orange and lemon juices into the bowl with the zest. Add the champagne vinegar, Dijon, honey and 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk together until the salt has dissolved. Add the oil and whisk until the dressing has emulsified.</p><p>Cut the avocado in half lengthwise. Peel and discard the pit. Dice the avocado and scatter the pieces over the top of the salad.</p><p>Lightly dress the salad with the vinaigrette and sprinkle the almonds over the top. Place the remaining vinaigrette in a re-sealable container and refrigerate for another use.</p><p><strong>Jill's Wine Recommendations:</strong> The 2009 Reichsrat von Buhl Riesling Sekt is a bubbly, dry wine from Pfalz, Germany. This pairs beautifully with the vibrant blood orange in the salad.If you have problems finding a sparkling Riesling you could use a Spanish Cava instead.</p>",

I added the buttery richness of diced avocado and slivered almonds for an element of crunch. This salad is a wonderful accompaniment to the Roasted Lobster Tails and rounds out the menu for a romantic Valentine's dinner. I've given you the quantities for two, but this salad can easily be scaled up. The proportions for the dressing will be enough to dress 4 salads."

Spray a standard-size (not jumbo) 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick spray and line each cup with a paper cupcake liner.</p><p>Scoop the butternut pieces into a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap, poke a few holes in the top, and microwave on high for 10 minutes. Uncover the bowl and mash with the back of a large spoon until it's the consistency of loose mashed potatoes. Let cool completely.</p><p>In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar with <em>&frac14; cup</em> of the pecans and set aside. Stir the sour cream and vanilla into the now-cool butternut, then whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth (though if you have a few lumps you can't get rid of, that's okay).</p><p>Pour the flour, granulated sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment&mdash;or, if you're using a hand mixer, into a large bowl&mdash;and mix on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the butter and mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer, add half of the squash mixture and beat on medium speed for 30 seconds. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, add the rest of the squash and beat on medium until you have a smooth batter, about 30 seconds more. Add the remaining <em>&frac12; cup</em> of the pecans and mix until just incorporated.</p><p>Divide the batter among the muffin cups (you'll use about 3 tablespoons per muffin) and top each with a rounded teaspoon of the brown sugar mixture. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, for about 25 minutes, until the muffins spring back when gently pressed and a skewer inserted into their middle comes out almost clean (a few crumbs attached is fine). Cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 20 minutes before unmolding.</p>",

It's fall as I'm writing these words, we've just picked the butternut from our garden, and, with these muffins in the oven, the house smells so amazing I can't imagine ever leaving. Their texture is so moist, tender and surprisingly light (they stay moist for several days after baking). And the nutty crunch of pecan is the perfect foil to their gentle sweetness."
